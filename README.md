# KeplerQuest-AI — Augmented Reality Client (keplerquest-ar)

This repository contains the **Augmented Reality (AR) client** developed as part of the *KeplerQuest-AI* project.  
The AR client is implemented in **Unity** and provides immersive visualizations of orbital mechanics that can be adapted to support inquiry-based and interactive learning experiences in STEM education.

This repository focuses exclusively on the **technological infrastructure** of the AR component and is designed to be reusable in educational and research contexts beyond the original study.

## Overview

The AR client enables users to visualize and explore concepts related to **Kepler’s laws of planetary motion** through interactive 3D representations. It is intended to be used in conjunction with an external conversational AI system but can also operate independently as a standalone AR visualization tool.

This repository is part of the broader *KeplerQuest-AI* ecosystem, which is organized into two main technological components:

- **Augmented Reality Client (this repository)**
- **LLM-Based Chatbot Backend** (`keplerquest-llm`)

## Key Features

- Unity-based augmented reality application
- Interactive 3D visualizations of orbital mechanics
- Modular design to support adaptation to other scientific topics
- Compatibility with external AI-driven conversational systems
- Designed for reproducibility and extension
